Welcome to the deployment repository for the **Streamlit app** that visualizes the value factors released by the [International Foundation for Valuing Impacts](https://ifvi.org) (IFVI). This app provides an interactive interface for exploring these value factors, allowing users to filter by country and explore them by category.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to deploying the Streamlit application that enables users to interact with the IFVI value factors. These factors are part of the Global Value Factors Database, released in late 2024 during UN Climate Week. They offer a comprehensive method for companies to convert their environmental impacts into monetary terms, supporting impact accounting practices.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Navigate through value factors using a user-friendly interface.
- **Country and Category Filtering**: Easily filter value factors by specific countries and categories.
- **Impact Accounting Support**: Provides tools for integrating environmental impacts into financial reporting.

## Related Repositories

- **Global Value Factors Explorer Repository**: This separate repository contains the source data for these visualizations. It provides a derivative dataset based on the official IFEI data.
- **Documentation Repository**: Contains detailed documentation for the derivative database used in this visualization project.

## About The IFVI Value Factors

The IFVI value factors are geographically stratified multipliers designed to be paired with quantitative data, facilitating their integration into financial reporting. They serve as a potential bridge between traditional accounting methods and the inclusion of social and environmental impacts in financial analysis.
